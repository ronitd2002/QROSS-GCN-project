# QROSS project :

This project is a summer intern work under Dr Pawel Gora for the optimization of the relaxation parameter present during the QUBO calls for specific tasks for example a TSP Problem which is a graph hamiltonian problem. This task is a computationally heavy task and to solve the same we use a Graph Convoluional Neural Network to get TSP instances and then solve the same using QUBO train the layer for the relazation parameter and use a Neural network to minimize and optimize the computational load by learning the relaxation parameter.
