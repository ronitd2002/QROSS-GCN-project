# QROSS project :

## Progress so far
### Extracting the feature vectors for each graph
* Tested a naive autoencoder. Didn't work horrendous results.
* Extracted data nicely and plotted some correlation graphs. (EDA stuff)
* Finally built a graph feature vector extractor. Huge improvement.
* Ideal case scenario is to use a graph attention transformer instead of a GCN to conserve the identity of the graphs. Will do that soon.
* Built a min_relaxation_parameter.

### Build a neural network by training against the min_relaxation_parameter.

## Problems encountered so far:
