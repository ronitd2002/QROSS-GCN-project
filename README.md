# QROSS project :

## Progress so far
* Tested a naive autoencoder. Didn't work horrendous results.
* Extracted data nicely and plotted some correlation graphs. (EDA stuff)
* Finally built a graph feature vector extractor. Huge improvement.
* Ideal case scenario is to use a graph attention transformer instead of a GCN to conserve the identity of the graphs. Will do that soon.

## Problems encountered so far:
Check caveats.md file.
