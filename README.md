### QROSS-GCN-project

Summer project on Graph Convolutional Networks and TSP case study problem to implement the paper titled "QROSS : QUBO Relaxation Parameter Optimisation Via Learning Solver Surrogates" where we optimize the relaxation parameter via a solver surrogate neural network to reduce the number of costly QUBO calls especially in scenarios where the graph is complicated and large like in case of TSP problem.
