**Instances :** \\
 Graph instances. TSP solutions will be evaluated from them. 85 instances of 30 coordinate (`[x,y]`) graphs. Solutions will be for TSP30. Each instance is a `.tsp` file.

 **Data :** \\
 Data for 100 runs of the graph instance $j$ giving a relaxation paramter, a P_f probability, E_avg, E_min, E_std for each $j^{th}$ run. $100*5$ matrices for each j-th graph instance.
